Clock, Currency Value, Currency Thread, Currency are the main classes. SortQueue contains sorting criteria(According to the timestamp recieved.)

Difficulties faced:


Firstly, Server 2 did not need a listening server.

Realising serversocket.accept() is a blocking call.

Realising i need two dispatcher threads so as to listen to two other peers and one worker thread. The lack of client server model was difficult to simulate at the start.

Synchronising all the methods between all the threads.
